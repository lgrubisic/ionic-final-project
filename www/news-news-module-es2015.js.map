The Museum’s backstage holds the remaining pieces of the historical Collection: hundreds of cars, engines,\\n        objects, mechanical parts, trophies, models. An extraordinary patrimony safely kept in the\\n        storage rooms in Arese, in a space separate from the Museum halls, which is organised over two stories like an actual garage. The Collection is in fact an operational space in every sense, the special reserve we can tap into on special\\n        occasions, such as exhibitions or events.\\n        In the year of its 110th anniversary, Alfa Romeo will open the doors of this extraordinary area – which has been closed to the public until now – to reveal the unseen chapters of the Brand’s history to Alfa enthusiasts worldwide.\\n        A journey called Open Backstage – a virtual journey for now – which will be hosted by the @museoalfaromeo Facebook and Instagram channels. With a number of videos and posts supported by the shootings carried out by the few photographers who\\n        have been granted exceptional access to these ‘hidden’ treasures, we will guide\\n        you through this discovery of some truly special pieces: from the Alfetta Spider and the Eagle, both designed by Pininfarina in the 1970s, to the Alfa Centauri prototype; from the 177 that marked Alfa Romeo’s return to Formula 1 in 1979 to\\n        the Romeo tractor; from the futuristic Scarabeo to the incredible 164 Pro Car which,\\n        under its family sedan body, hid a mechanics derived from Formula 1.\\n        When we will get the green light to reopen the Museum in Arese to the public, visitors will also be able to visit this area of the Collection live in small groups and with pre-booked guided tours: a surprise that Alfa Romeo would like to\\n        dedicate to all lovers of the Biscione in this special year for the brand (for information:\\n        collezione@museoalfaromeo.com).\\n        Some of these objects – in total more than 150 cars, 100 engines, protype components and equipment, as well as dozens of trophies, models, artworks and much more – were exceptionally exhibited in the Museum for one day on the occasion of the\\n        series of Backstage events, a monthly review of meetings dedicated to an in-depth study of the less known chapters in the brand’s history. In 2019, and in the first months of 2020, we ‘revealed’ - and, whenever possible, started the engines –\\n        of some rather unknown models, like the “Yugoslavia” prototype, a forefather of the Giulia from 1959, the Tipo 103, and the prototype of the New York Taxi designed\\n        by Giorgetto Giugiaro for the M.O.M.A. in New York. Or, even outside the automotive industry, just to prove Alfa Romeo’s eclectic nature, the racing motorboat Popoli, the futuristic kitchen which was the brand’s ‘alternative’ production\\n        during the war, or the authored sculptures commissioned by Alfa Romeo from artists like Arnaldo and Giò Pomodoro, Bruno Munari or Luigi Fontana. The full series of 2020 Backstage events will resume as soon as the Museum reopens. Read the full\\n        programme here:\\n        <br /><br />\\n        In the meantime, thanks to this virtual tour of the storage rooms in Arese, join us for a discovery tour of the other unseen pieces, many of which – like the C.E.M., for instance, an innovative electronic engine control system from the 1970s\\n        – testify to the intense and innovative research performed by Alfa Romeo throughout its history. But also cars and projects which made people dream in the past, or could have made them dream, had they not remained prototypes and had they had\\n        the chance to prove their worth to the world.\\n        Enjoy the ride!\\n        <br /><br />\\n        We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the following photographers for allowing us to use their shots to offer this virtual ‘backstage’ journey of the museum while the museum stays closed to the public due to the Covid-19\\n        emergency:<br />\\n        Rémi Dargegen<br />\\n        Dennis Van Noten<br />\\n        Kevin van Campenhout<br />\\n        PlanImage<br />\\n        2020 Archivio Zagato – Zed Milano srl<br />\\n        Bernd Schweickard<br />\\n        Degler_Studio.<br />\\n\\n        <br /><br />\\n        Info: museoalfaromeo.com\\n      </p>\\n    </ion-slide>\\n\\n    <ion-slide>\\n      <img src=\\\"../../assets/img/n2.jpg\\\" />\\n      <h2>HOLIDAY OPENING</h2>\\n      <p>\\n        Throughout the upcoming holidays, the Alfa Romeo Museum will be open during regular opening hours: every day, except Tuesdays, from 10 am to 6 pm.

A project involving\\n        10 Milanese museums to stimulate the enjoyment of works of art in the world capital of design. From Saturday, December 7.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        Art and beauty, elegance and Italian design. The sinuous curves of the Alfa Romeo 8C 2900 B Lungo and the enveloping volumes of Feltri, the iconic armchair designed by Gaetano Pesce for Cassina: an open dialogue between \\\"objects\\\" that are\\n        only apparently distant, to combine the different expertises of Milan, city of art and world capital of design. Starting Saturday 7 December, the Museo Storico Alfa Romeo in Arese will stage this original encounter between cars and furniture,\\n        as part of the project \\\"Muse dialoganti\\\" (Muses in dialogue), promoted by the Association MuseoCity and presented on Tuesday 3 December at the Museo del Novecento in Milan. The project is based on the idea of bringing together art and design,\\n        a work of art and a piece of furniture to further the authentic enjoyment of both. Therefore, 10 extraordinary design pieces, produced and donated by 8 Italian companies that strive to support cultural consumption, will be displayed in 10\\n        cultural institutes in Milan. In addition to the Alfa Romeo Museum, also the Historic House-Museum Boschi Di Stefano, the Civic Archaeological Museum, the GAM Gallery of Modern Art, the Museo del Novecento, the Museum of Natural History, the\\n        Leonardo da Vinci National Museum of Science and Technology, Palazzo Morando Costume Moda e Immagine, Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and Pinacoteca di Brera, will create authentic installations to display sofas or armchairs by Baxter, Cappellini,\\n        Cassina, Giorgetti, Horm Italia, Kartell, Molteni & C. and Moroso. The encounter between functionality and aesthetics is one of the founding elements of Alfa Romeo's DNA: speed and beauty as values to be pursued, lightness and simplicity as\\n        tools to achieve them. The Museum in Arese will illustrate a research process lasting 110 years that has given rise to cars bearing the signature of the greatest Italian designers: from Bertone to Giugiaro, from Scaglione to Pininfarina, all\\n        the way to the Alfa Romeo Style Centre. Precisely this natural propensity for design and beauty lies behind the Museum’s decision to participate in the \\\"Muse dialoganti\\\" project. Which area of the Museum was most suitable to let visitors\\n        contemplate a particularly significant work of art? The choice came rather naturally: obviously in the section entitled Beauty, which is dedicated to design - right in front of the monumental 8C 2900 B Lungo from 1937, the queen of mundane\\n        life of its time and, at the same time, the \\\"fastest production car in the world\\\", as Cecil Clutton defined it on Motor Sport. A masterpiece of the Milanese Touring bodywork, with a powder blue sartorial \\\"dress\\\" entirely handcrafted by the\\n        sheet-metal workers, covering the gritty and powerful mechanics, which allowed this same vehicle to prevail a few years later in that gruelling race through Italy known as the Mille Miglia. In front of the imposing silhouette of the 8C 2900 B\\n        Lungo – which has been the object of the desire of collectors worldwide – visitors will now be able to contemplate the vehicle comfortably wrapped in the embrace of the armchair Feltri, designed by Gaetano Pesce and manufactured by Cassina. A\\n        unique work, which distinguishes itself by its great malleability. Feltri was conceived in Cassina’s Research Centre, a place of experimentation and cutting-edge construction, where Gaetano Pesce dedicated himself to the project and developed\\n        a complex production technique patented by the company. For the material, Gaetano Pesce envisioned \\\"a new application of an old material which, in ancient times, even before 'fabric', was able to protect human bodies from both cold and heat.\\n        The shape is \\\"simple, in-between a dress and a seat\\\", and the technique is \\\"highly advanced employing synthetic resins in their \\\"liquid\\\" essence, before catalysation, combined with the traditional, manual skill of the people who work at\\n        Cassina. The armchair is entirely made of thick wool felt and combines the wraparound and mouldable backrest with the rigid and resistant base, which is impregnated in thermosetting resin. The seat is fixed to the structure by means of hemp\\n        straps that also outline the upper part of the chair. A comfortable quilted mattress paired with polyester wadding covers the inside of the armchair. “Elective affinities\\\" is what you call it when some elements attract each other and create\\n        new compositions. The \\\"Feltri\\\" armchair with its large, soft, mouldable and comfortable volumes is the exact opposite of the 8C 2900, so solid and stable in its shapes. Yet the soft lines of both objects find surprising points of convergence.\\n        \\\"The challenge of this initiative is the attempt to integrate seats that do not visually pollute the museum spaces but which, on the contrary, blend in with the environment and enter into dialogue with the surrounding spaces and the works\\n        exhibited in them. In fact, every piece of furniture in relation to the work becomes a small installation in itself, and tells the story of a possible relationship between art and design,\\\" say Ludovica and Roberto Palomba, the\\n        architect-designers who have been in charge of the project from its conception to its execution. The project was created by MuseoCity in collaboration with Palomba Serafini Associati and with the contribution of Fondazione Cariplo and\\n        UniCredit.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        FELTRI by Cassina: find out more\\n      </p>\\n    </ion-slide>\\n\\n    <ion-slide>\\n      <img src=\\\"../../assets/img/n4.png\\\" />\\n      <h2>EXHIBIT: \\\"THE MUSEUM BACKSTAGE\\\"</h2>\\n      <p>\\n        What goes on \\\"backstage\\\"? All through 2019, the Museo Alfa Romeo in Arese has been proposing a series of events to reveal that part of the historical Collection that is not permanently displayed but kept in the Museum storage rooms and\\n        therefore invisible to the public. Once a month, one of these 'objects' – cars, models, and much more – has starred in an event called Backstage: it was displayed for an entire weekend and presented to the public during an in-depth conference\\n        enriched with materials from the Documentation Centre. In addition, whenever possible, the Museum invited former Alfa Romeo employees to give their live testimony of the object in question, people who had personally worked on the project in\\n        its day, as well as experts or fans. The Backstage events were also the perfect occasion to set some of the vehicles that had been standing still for decades back in motion and – in some cases – to take them back to the track.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        Throughout 2019, the Museum thus meticulously illustrated 12 chapters in Alfa Romeo's history by means of as many items which will now, at the end of the season, parade together in the Backstage Parade at the Museo Alfa Romeo in Arese.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        From 7 December 2019 to 2 March 2020, the Museum will put the less known vehicles on show, like the white armoured Alfa 6 which was specially prepared for Pope John Paul II's visit to Milan. Then there is the 164 Q4 transformed into a pick-up\\n        truck for the Firefighting Department located in Balocco, Alfa Romeo's experimental testing centre. Or the 1900 M 'Matta', which, in 1967, embarked on a journey with four Giulia Supers to cover 27 thousand kilometres crossing 24 countries to\\n        bring a message of peace with the Brotherhood and Peace Raid. And then there was the 'mother of all Giulias', i.e. the temporary and camouflaged prototype of the Giulia, which bore the date 12 December 1959 on its grille. Or again the\\n        'forerunner' of the Alfa, the Darracq 8/10 HP produced in the Portello production plant which, in 1910, would become the A.L.F.A. workshops.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        Exhibited at the Mo.Ma. in New York, the New York Taxi conceived by Giorgetto Giugiaro on the platform of the Alfa Romeo F12 anticipated many of the future trends in automotive design. Then came the prototype of the Tipo 103, a futuristic\\n        project for a vetturetta from the 1950s. The spotlights also shone on the Wankel engine and the C.E.M. (Electronic Engine Control), an example of technological excellence from the early 1980s that placed Alfa Romeo in the frontline in terms\\n        of the application of electronic devices in the automotive industry. And again, the 'section'ofthe Alfetta, which lays bare the functioning of every component, from the body to the suspensions, from the 'twin-shaft' engine to the gearbox and\\n        the entire transmission and braking system.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        The exhibition comes to a close with some items that bear witness to Alfa Romeo's sensitivity and commitment, also beyond the automotive industry: the futuristic prototype of a kitchen designed during the Second World War and never launched\\n        into production, and the series of authored sculptures entitled 'Alfa Romeo to its drivers', twenty Trophies made between 1963 and 1982 by the greatest Italian artists of the time.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        The exhibition Backstage Parade will remain open from 7 December 2019 to 2 March 2020, and will then leave room for the pieces of Alfa Romeo's historical Collection that will star in the 2020 Edition of Backstage.\\n        <br /><br />\\n        The dates and topics of the events will be published on the Backstage section\\n      </p>\\n    </ion-slide>\\n  </ion-slides>\\n</ion-content>\\n\"","import { IonicModule } from '@ionic/angular';\nimport { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { News } from './news.page';\nimport { ExploreContainerComponentModule } from '../explore-container/explore-container.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    IonicModule,\n    CommonModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    ExploreContainerComponentModule,\n    RouterModule.forChild([{ path: '', component: News }])\n  ],\n  declarations: [News]\n})\nexport class NewsModule {}\n","export default \"ion-content ion-toolbar {\\n  --background: translucent;\\n}\\n\\n:root {\\n  --ion-safe-area-top: 20px;\\n  --ion-safe-area-bottom: 22px;\\n}\\n\\n.swiper-slide {\\n  display: block;\\n}\\n\\nion-slide > h2 {\\n  margin-top: 2.8rem;\\n}\\n\\nion-slide > img {\\n  max-height: 50%;\\n  max-width: 60%;\\n  margin: 36px 0;\\n}\\n\\n.pulsate {\\n  -webkit-animation: pulsate 3s ease-out;\\n  -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;\\n  opacity: 0.5;\\n}\\n\\n@-webkit-keyframes pulsate {\\n  0% {\\n    opacity: 0.5;\\n  }\\n  50% {\\n    opacity: 1;\\n  }\\n  100% {\\n    opacity: 0.5;\\n  }\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,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 */\"","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-news',\n  templateUrl: 'news.page.html',\n  styleUrls: ['news.page.scss']\n})\nexport class News {\n\n  slideOpts = {\n    initialSlide: 1,\n    speed: 400\n  };\n  constructor() {}\n\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
